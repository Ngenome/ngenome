# Kelvin Ng'eno

Full-stack developer building products across web, mobile, and AI. Based in Nairobi.

Currently CTO at [Navismart AI](https://navismartai.com) — an AI-powered immigration platform — and founder of [Dissolve Software](https://dissolveafrica.com), a consultancy delivering custom software for SMEs across East Africa.

## What I Build

**Frontend**: React, Next.js, Vue.js, React Native (iOS & Android) — with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Framer Motion. I care about component architecture, interaction design, responsive layouts, and making complex workflows feel simple.

**Backend**: FastAPI, Django, Node.js, Phoenix — with PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, GraphQL. I've built payment systems (Stripe, BNPL), auth flows (Clerk, OAuth), background job queues, and real-time streaming APIs.

**AI/ML**: OpenAI Agents SDK, Langgraph, CrewAI, PyTorch, Transformers. I've fine-tuned language models, built multi-agent systems, and integrated LLMs into production applications.

**AI-Assisted Development**: I use Claude Code daily. I maintain CLAUDE.md files that define design tokens, component APIs, naming conventions, and accessibility standards — so AI-generated code matches the team's patterns from the first output.

## How I Work

I build for real users in real conditions — including low-bandwidth environments, mobile-dominant usage, and markets where software needs to earn trust through clarity and reliability. Most of my work serves East African businesses and individuals.

I treat AI tooling as a precision instrument, not an autocomplete. I write project context documents (CLAUDE.md) that encode design systems, component patterns, and accessibility requirements so AI-generated code is production-ready from the first generation.
